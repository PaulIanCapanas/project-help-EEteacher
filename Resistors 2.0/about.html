                              The irregular students decided to team up on this particular project in order for us to test ourselves and
                              in order to help each other on future circumstances. This project was initially created by Paul and Aaron 
                              and on the end we decided to add Geovanni in our roaster. The theme and the main motto of this company is and will always be 
                              "Win or Lose as long as we work together". We will win as one "Win together, Lose together, Slay together", like OG.

                                The whole inspiration on why we made this particular project and the one who molded us is our own
                                one and only sir Vitini Idemne. As a student we saw and observed that he was having a hard time in dealing with
                                the particular tools in the internet, doing stuff in a technological way, and all in all in or present
                                technology. He's not a technologicaly oriented person, and as well we concluded that he is good in manual 
                                kind of tasks and the way he teaches us in our class. Also the other sole purpose is that before doing and graduating 
                                we must make and impact and help teachers on their classes.

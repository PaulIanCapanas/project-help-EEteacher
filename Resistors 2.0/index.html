							The resistor is a passive electrical component that creates resistance 
							in the flow of electric current. In almost all electrical
							networks and electronic circuits they can be found. The resistance
							is measured in ohms (Ω). An ohm is the resistance 
							that occurs when a current of one ampere (A) passes
							through a resistor with a one volt (V) drop across 
							its terminals. The current is proportional to the voltage across 
							the terminal ends.Resistors are used for many purposes. A 
							few examples include limiting electric current, voltage division, heat generation, 
							matching and loading circuits, gain control, and setting time constants. 
							They are commercially available with resistance values over a range
							of more than nine orders of magnitude. They can be 
							used as electric brakes to dissipate kinetic energy from trains, 
							or be smaller than a square millimeter for electronics.

							Otis Boykin's work on better electrical resistors enabled the continuous operation of a wide range of electrical equipment. 
							His resistor innovations are utilized in televisions, radios, computers, pacemakers, and guided missiles, among other things.
							Boykin devised his wire precision resistor in 1959, and two years later refined it to endure high temperature and pressure fluctuations. 
							It was less expensive and more dependable than earlier models, and it was in great demand by the United States military, IBM, and other 
							high-tech firms. In 1964, he created a control device for pacemakers that allowed for exact regulation. Boykin's innovations meant that 
							many electronic devices could be produced cheaper and more dependable than before.
